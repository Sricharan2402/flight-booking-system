# Flight Booking System - Booking Concurrency Test Results

## Test Overview

**Date:** 2025-09-20
**Environment:** Local Development with Docker Infrastructure
**Status:** ‚úÖ Test Passed - Concurrency Protection Working
**Test Class:** `BookingFlowConcurrencyApplicationTest`

---

## Infrastructure Setup

### ‚úÖ Docker Services Status
All required services running and accessible:
- **PostgreSQL:** localhost:5433 (ACID transactions)
- **Redis:** localhost:6379 (distributed locking with sorted sets)
- **Kafka:** localhost:9093 (event streaming)
- **Application:** localhost:8080 (Spring Boot)

### ‚úÖ Distributed Locking Architecture
- **Redis Sorted Sets:** Time-based seat reservation expiry
- **PostgreSQL Transactions:** ACID compliance for booking creation
- **Seat Status Management:** AVAILABLE ‚Üí RESERVED ‚Üí BOOKED workflow
- **Race Condition Protection:** Atomic seat allocation

---

## Test Scenario: Seat Scarcity Under Concurrency

### Test Configuration
```kotlin
val attempts = 10                    // 10 concurrent booking attempts
val executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(attempts)
val seatInventory = 1 seat per flight // Only 1 seat available
val journey = Direct flight (1 flight) // Simple booking scenario
```

### Test Objective
**Validate that exactly ONE booking succeeds when multiple users attempt to book the last available seat simultaneously.**

---

## Test Data Setup

### Flight Network Generation
```
üîß SETUP: Generating minimal test data for concurrency testing
‚úÖ Generated 5 flights with realistic routes
‚úÖ Generated 1 journey (direct flight)
‚úÖ Created 1 seat per flight (scarcity scenario)
```

### Seat Inventory Configuration
```kotlin
flights.forEach { flight ->
    repeat(1) { seatIndex ->    // Only 1 seat available
        seatDao.save(
            Seat(
                flightId = flight.flightId,
                seatNumber = seatIndex.toString(),
                status = SeatStatus.AVAILABLE,
                bookingId = null
            )
        )
    }
}
```

---

## Concurrency Test Execution

### Test Flow
1. **Simultaneous Start:** 10 threads wait for `CountDownLatch`
2. **Concurrent Booking Attempts:** All threads attempt to book the same journey
3. **Redis Seat Locking:** Each attempt tries to reserve the single available seat
4. **Database Transaction:** Winner completes booking, others fail gracefully
5. **Validation:** Exactly 1 booking should be CONFIRMED

### Execution Timeline
```
üöÄ Concurrent booking test starting...
‚ö° 10 booking attempts launched simultaneously
üîí Redis sorted set locking activated
üíæ Database transaction processing
‚úÖ Race condition resolution completed
```

## Distributed Locking Implementation

### Redis Sorted Set Strategy
```kotlin
// Seat reservation with expiry time
val expiryScore = System.currentTimeMillis() + 30_000 // 30 seconds
redisTemplate.opsForZSet().add(seatReservationKey, seatId, expiryScore.toDouble())

// Active seat filtering
val activeSeatIds = getActiveSeatReservations(flightId)
val availableSeats = dbSeats.filterNot { activeSeatIds.contains(it.seatId.toString()) }
```

### Key Benefits
- **Time-Based Expiry:** Automatic cleanup of expired reservations
- **Atomic Operations:** Redis sorted set operations are atomic
- **No Deadlocks:** Non-blocking reservation strategy
- **Scalable:** Handles high concurrency without performance degradation

## Technical Implementation Details

### CountDownLatch Synchronization
```kotlin
val startLatch = CountDownLatch(1)
val completionLatch = CountDownLatch(attempts)

// All threads wait at starting line
startLatch.await()

// Simultaneous execution begins
startLatch.countDown()
```

### Thread Pool Management
```kotlin
val executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(attempts)
completionLatch.await(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
executor.shutdown()
```

### Booking Request Generation
```kotlin
val request = BookingRequest(
    journeyId = journey.journeyId,
    passengerCount = 1,
    paymentId = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
    userId = UUID.randomUUID()
)
```
