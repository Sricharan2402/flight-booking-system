# User Prompts Log

## Prompt 1
starting with this prompt, log all prompts in a markdown file called userPrompts.md. Log them as they are.

## Prompt 2
is there a way for me to get my prompts log without doing this? Is there a custom command?

## Prompt 3
You are a senior engineer writing a design doc that is both HLD + LLD for a flight booking system. The implementation will be done in Kotlin + Spring Boot, Gradle, and local docker setup with Postgres, Redis, Kafka. I'll give a brief system context, you expand it into a professional but human-readable design doc. It should include intro, requirements, entities, components, flows, schema-level details, and the key algorithms (no need for actual code, just algo explanation). @designPrompt.md has the design prompt. Create a filed named DesignDoc.md with this.

## Prompt 4
check the entities again and update accordingly, also the HLD diagram is incorrect, client interacts with booking service as well, and the admin service interacts with DB to create flights, then pushes event to Kafka

## Prompt 5
Please analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file, which will be given to future instances of Claude Code to operate in this repository.

What to add:
1. Commands that will be commonly used, such as how to build, lint, and run tests. Include the necessary commands to develop in this codebase, such as how to run a single test.
2. High-level code architecture and structure so that future instances can be productive more quickly. Focus on the "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand.

Usage notes:
- If there's already a CLAUDE.md, suggest improvements to it.
- When you make the initial CLAUDE.md, do not repeat yourself and do not include obvious instructions like "Provide helpful error messages to users", "Write unit tests for all new utilities", "Never include sensitive information (API keys, tokens) in code or commits".
- Avoid listing every component or file structure that can be easily discovered.
- Don't include generic development practices.
- If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include the important parts.
- If there is a README.md, make sure to include the important parts.
- Do not make up information such as "Common Development Tasks", "Tips for Development", "Support and Documentation" unless this is expressly included in other files that you read.
- Be sure to prefix the file with the following text:

```
# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.
```
## Prompt 6
the HLD diagram in @DesignDoc.md is still incorrect, there are two clients, User and Admin. Both interact via Gateway. Admin client to admin service, user client to search and booking service. Admin, Ingestion consumer, Booking and Search all interact with DB. Correct this

## Prompt 7
You missed admin client interacting with admin service. Stack them all vertically, admin and user clients. Followed by API Gateway, ALL services interact with the Database. ALL services except ingestion consumer gets requests from API Gateway. SERVICES REQUEST TO CACHES, not the other way around. SEPARATE the cache for booking and search service

## Prompt 8
separate out the flows in HLD in @DesignDoc.md. The client facing flows as one, the ingestion flow as the other

## Prompt 9
not the algo, just the HLD diagram

## Prompt 10
cehck the @userPrompts.md file. From the NEXT command (not this command), add similar logs of my user prompts

## Prompt 11
Convert this repository into a Kotlin Gradle Spring Boot project. Make changes as required - add build.gradle.kts changes, configure dependencies

## Prompt 12
lets keep it simple, continue with just the src folder, we dont need multi module setup. follow proper folder structure inside the src folder

## Prompt 13
lets not start coding ryt away. complete making this bootRUnnable with spring boot. Lets start actual coding later

## Prompt 14
do a gradle build

## Prompt 15
upgrade java to 21 and related configs. Also the dependencies that you've commented out, remove anything that is not immediately necessary, we can add them later on if required.

## Prompt 16
Going forward, log my prompts in the @userPrompts.md file in the same way its present. Just the prompt as it is

## Prompt 17
To test this project, we will create Postgres, Redis, and Kafka containers on Docker and connect to them locally, to achieve this, create a docker-compose.yml file inside a  subfolder called docker, and add the images mentioned.

## Prompt 18
follow @claude-rules/dockerRules.md for this, store variables in env files, document the containers created etc correctly. Also use ports other than the default ports as I have other local installations

## Prompt 19
Going forward, log my prompts in the @userPrompts.md file in the same way its present. Just the prompt as it is

## Prompt 20
Create the infra for connecting to posgres that is running via the docker local setup. Add postgres dependencies, jooq generator config, application.yml config changes. use the correct db name, user, password info

## Prompt 21
jooq dependency is failing, check incompatibilites, spring boot to upconflicts or something, upgrade spring boot to 3.5

## Prompt 22
going forward, do not do gradle builds, prompt me and I'll do them, don'waste your token on them

## Prompt 23
create the migration files follow the rules in @claude-rules/postgresSetupRules.md. Refer to @DesignDoc.md for the schema. Also create created_at, updated_at columns for all tables where created_at defaults to now, updated_at defaults to now and create triggers on all updated_at to get updated to now() whenever a record changes

## Prompt 24
remove all FK references. Do not use FK anywhere in this project

## Prompt 25
flyway is failing, check

## Prompt 26
Going forward, log my prompts in the @userPrompts.md file in the same way its present. Just the prompt as it is

## Prompt 27
lets start with the actual dev. First create open API specs in side resouces in a subfolder called open-api, create APIs for the flows that we've pointed out. For the Admin service, create a create flight API, for the user, there's the search for flights and book a flight APIs

## Prompt 28
Healh is repeated across all files. We dont need that. keep it once, maybe in a separate file called health controller, remove all examples, default values fromt the openAPI spec. FlightSegment has been repeated twice, again, check the rules in @claude-rules/openApiRules.md, keep repeated components in a common spec file and reuse them. Name it just Flight, not flight segment.

## Prompt 29
Create an open API server spec generation config in @build.gradle.kts for this

## Prompt 30
remove any mentions of duration_minutes from entities across DB, openAPI, just use departure and arrival times across, also update in the designdoc

## Prompt 31
Create departure and arrival times for journeys too, across specs, migrations, docs

## Prompt 32
Lets start creating the actual application layers, lets start with the Admin flow, we will concentrate on the flight creation part (ignoring the consumer, journey creation steps), create the plan for domain Models, controller layer, service layer, Dao layers, its mappers etc. Follow any and all rules in @claude-rules/

## Prompt 33
kafka is not initialized. Setup kafka producers, consumers for this, under folders producers, consumers inside com.flightbooking, configure necessary dependencies, add configs, then setup the consumer for this event too. As an extension Create the Journey service, Journey data layer and wrtie up the BFS
based logic to add scheudles based on new flights being added and existing flights ON THE SAME DAY. Draft a plan for all of this. Look at the existing folder structure, naming conventions and use the same throughout. Keep business validations to a minimum for now.

## Prompt 34
You wouldnt need JourneyCreationRequest correct? Strictly follow structure and naming conventions.

## Prompt 35
Journey needs to have departure and arrival time across layers. Add it in the migration files, and anywhere else.

## Prompt 36
@src/main/kotlin/com/flightbooking/data/JourneyDaoImpl.kt fix syntax issues here

## Prompt 37
Going forward, log my prompts in the @userPrompts.md file in the same way its present. Just the prompt as it is

## Prompt 38
@src/main/kotlin/com/flightbooking/services/journeys/JourneyGenerationService.kt Generalise this into an actual BFS implementation. Also as a rule of thumb always use enums for Status fields across entities, Flights, Journeys, Bookings etc. For now, let's make that change in the domain layer and let the API Wire object remain String. Plan this and present it

## Prompt 39
Lets implement the search and booking functionalitites now. Refer to @DesignDoc.md for the flows. Follow @claude-rules/ for conventions. Ignore business validations for now. Do not use @valid annotations in controllers. Additionally, configure a jedis client to connect to redis, and create a reusable redis client with basic functions such as set, get, and expire, then extend this in separate services for caching or locking purposes as and when needed. Draft a plan for this

## Prompt 40
As part of this, go ahead and create seats for a flight during flight creation, NOT JOURNEY CREATION, seats are for a flight, get a num seats value in the flight creation request API and create that many seats in the DB. then you can use that in booking flows. Add this to the plan as well. Lets split the plan into two parts. First is everything except redis stuff. Present the plan

## Prompt 41
could you backfill my prompts in the @userPrompts.md log please

## Prompt 42
remove any usage of suspend methods for now. If that means removing blocks where Dispatchers.IO are used, that is fine. We can fix this later.

## Prompt 43
exception bifurcation can be removed for now. Just handle a common exception, that too only in the data layer, producer, and consumers for now. Remove exception handling in service layers and controllers everywhere

## Prompt 44
backfill my prompts on @userPrompts.md

## Prompt 45
fix mapper errors in the controller to wire layer. Check for any other syntax issues after that.

## Prompt 46
get the context from @DesignDoc.md, Go through the @src/ folder to get context of the service. Once done, lmk if there are any pending implementations other than caching layers in search or lock flows, any TODO(), placeholder values, bugs etc

## Prompt 47
lets completely ignore authentication, API Gateway, scaling concerns, microservice missing. Take the actual bugs, TODO(), TBDs and list them,   1. Booking Service - Lack of Atomicity

  - Missing Redis distributed locks before seat reservation
  - No transaction rollback mechanism if seat assignment fails
  - Race condition potential in reserveSeatsForJourney() at BookingService.kt:112

  2. Journey Generation - Potential Infinite Loop

  - BFS algorithm in JourneyGenerationService.kt:47 could theoretically create very long paths
  - Missing validation for reasonable journey duration limits

  3. Data Consistency Issues

  - No implementation of the design's strong consistency requirements
  - Missing seat availability validation during concurrent bookings whats the diff b/w 1 and 3 if redis were to be implemented, which bugs would remain, just list them

## Prompt 48
go ahead and create a markdown file called openBugs.md, add to gitignore. Then draft a plan to add Redis implementation for the search caching and booking locking flows. Jedis client, correct dependencies, configs, then changes in actual service layer to use these

## Prompt 49
not the way i want to lock. i want to store the seatIds in a sorted set with expiryTime. then during booking flows, I get active seats from DB, then check in sorted set to filter elements, also remove expired elements from sorted set

## Prompt 50
implement this

## Prompt 51
there seem to be syntax issues in your changes, check and fix them

## Prompt 52
update oopenBugs.md with current status

## Prompt 53
backfill my prompts in @userPrompts.md, continue to log it there

## Prompt 54
Journey and JourneySearchResult seem redundant, just return a list of journeys in search response, should also take care of the flight number mapping bug

## Prompt 55
re evaluate openBugs now, also kafka connection is not working debug that
