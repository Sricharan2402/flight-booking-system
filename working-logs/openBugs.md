# Open Bugs and Issues

## TODO Comments

### ~~1. Available Seats Calculation in Search~~ ✅ **FIXED**
**Files**: SearchService.kt, SearchController.kt, SearchControllerMapper.kt
**Issue**: Search response always showed 0 available seats instead of actual counts
**Impact**: Users couldn't see actual seat availability during search
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Added searchJourneysWithSeats() method, integrated with existing calculateAvailableSeats() logic, passed seat counts to API mapper

### ~~2. User Authentication Context~~ ✅ **FIXED**
**File**: `src/main/kotlin/com/flightbooking/controller/mapper/BookingControllerMapper.kt`
**Issue**: Random UUID generated instead of authenticated user ID
**Impact**: Cannot track actual user bookings
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Updated BookingController to accept userId parameter, mapper now uses provided userId instead of random UUID

## Functional Bugs

### ~~3. Flight Number Generation~~ ✅ **FIXED**
**Issue**: Domain model had flightNumber field but database schema removed flight_number column
**Impact**: Database/domain model mismatch causing compilation issues
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Removed flightNumber field from domain model to match database schema (flight_number was removed in migration V8)

### ~~4. Journey Duration Validation Missing~~ ✅ **FIXED**
**File**: `src/main/kotlin/com/flightbooking/services/journeys/JourneyGenerationService.kt`
**Issue**: BFS algorithm could create unreasonably long journey durations (20+ hours)
**Impact**: System could generate impractical journeys with excessive layovers
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Added MAX_JOURNEY_DURATION (24 hours) validation, integrated into BFS algorithm with early path rejection

## ✅ RESOLVED - Search Model Refactoring

### ~~8. Redundant Search Models~~ ✅ **FIXED**
**Files**: SearchService.kt, SearchControllerMapper.kt, search-models.kt
**Issue**: JourneySearchResult and FlightSearchResult were redundant with Journey domain model
**Impact**: Code duplication and unnecessary mapping complexity
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Eliminated search result models, now using Journey domain model directly

## ✅ RESOLVED - Kafka Infrastructure

### ~~9. Kafka Connection Issues~~ ✅ **FIXED**
**Files**: docker-compose.yml
**Issue**: Kafka advertised listeners misconfigured causing connection failures
**Impact**: Flight events not processed, journey generation broken
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Fixed Kafka listeners configuration, internal connectivity working

## ✅ RESOLVED - Redis Implementation

### ~~5. Redis Distributed Locking~~ ✅ **FIXED**
**Files**: BookingService.kt, SeatReservationServiceImpl.kt
**Issue**: No distributed locks for seat reservation
**Impact**: Race conditions and potential double-booking
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Implemented atomic Lua script with sorted sets

### ~~6. Redis Search Caching~~ ✅ **FIXED**
**Files**: SearchService.kt, SearchCacheServiceImpl.kt
**Issue**: No caching layer for search results
**Impact**: Poor search performance, doesn't meet <100ms requirement
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Implemented Redis cache with 10-minute TTL

### ~~7. Seat Availability Validation~~ ✅ **FIXED**
**Files**: BookingService.kt, SeatReservationServiceImpl.kt
**Issue**: No atomic validation during concurrent bookings
**Impact**: Overselling seats during high-load scenarios
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Atomic reservation with Redis sorted sets

## Placeholder Implementations

### ~~8. Admin Controller~~ ✅ **FIXED**
**File**: `src/main/kotlin/com/flightbooking/controller/AdminFlightController.kt`
**Issue**: Incomplete admin controller implementation with placeholder comments
**Impact**: Basic flight management functionality missing
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Fully implemented AdminFlightController with proper service integration and mappers

## Summary

**Total Issues**: 11 (all issues resolved)
**✅ Resolved**: 11 (Redis implementation, search refactoring, Kafka connectivity, available seats, journey duration validation, authentication context, admin controller complete)
**❌ Open**: 0
**❌ Out of Scope**: 0

## 🎉 SYSTEM STATUS: READY FOR TESTING
